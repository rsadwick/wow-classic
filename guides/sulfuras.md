Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros is the weapon of choice for Ragnaros the Firelord. This weapon is not dropped, but rather may be created by anyone who has obtained both the  Sulfuron Hammer and the  Eye of Sulfuras. 

A blacksmith with a minimum skill of 300 is required to make a Sulfuron Hammer, and the Eye drops only and rarely from Ragnaros himself. The plans for the Sulfuron Hammer are obtained by turning in a Sulfuron Ingot into Lokhtos Darkbargainer in the Grim Guzzler in Blackrock Depths. There is no reputation requirement to receive the plans.
