Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is the legendary sword once wielded by Thunderaan, Prince of Air. The prince, son of Al'Akir the Windlord, was attacked by Ragnaros the Firelord, in an attempt to heighten the already impressive power that the fire elemental held. Ragnaros succeeded; however, Thunderaan's power could not be completely taken into his form. What remained of Thunderaan was placed in a talisman of elemental binding, which was broken into two pieces. The pieces were then given to the Firelord's two lieutenants, Baron Geddon and Garr, respectively the left and right halves. These two halves are known as the [Bindings of the Windseeker].

## Quest Line

This item is the final reward of a challenging and very expensive quest line, which can be started by a hunter, paladin, rogue, death knight, or warrior. It begins with Examine the Vessel, followed by Thunderaan the Windseeker, culminating with Rise, Thunderfury!.

The quest chain begins when you loot one half of the Bindings, which drop off Baron Geddon and Garr in Molten Core. Upon looting either of these, you must then travel to Silithus and speak with Highlord Demitrian. He will give you the  Vessel of Rebirth, which begins the quest line.

The next quest requires you to present the following items to Demitrian:
Both the left and the right Bindings of the Windseeker.
 Essence of the Firelord, which is a 100% drop from Ragnaros if you have the quest.
10x  Enchanted Elementium Bar, obtained from smelting rare Molten Core and Blackwing Lair reagents.
Bring a raid with you when you return with the required items to Demitrian, because he will promptly summon Thunderaan, whom is not the least bit happy that he was locked away for so long. Defeating Thunderaan causes him to drop his blade, whereupon you can receive the  Dormant Wind Kissed Blade. Deliver this to the now rather cowed Highlord, and he will make Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker for you.
