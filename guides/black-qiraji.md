This legendary mount was a reward for completing the now-removed questline associated with  Veteran of the Shifting Sands--but only within the first 10 hours of ringing the AQ gong ( Bang a Gong!). 

The last part of this epic questline could only be completed after the entire server joined together to donate items to the war effort and open the gates. As part of this quest chain, players had to rely upon raiders and friends to complete challenges such as timed runs of Blackwing Lair, crafting a buoy to lure a deadly shark that required extremely expensive and rare materials, farming green dragons for quest drops, and killing the insane Doctor Weavil. 

It truly exposed players to the lore of Azeroth--many players, even at the end of Wrath, wanted to complete this chain to experience a bit of the magic.

Players in later patches resorted to rerolling and transferring in the hopes of finding a server that still had the AQ gates closed. There's a few similar mounts in the game:  Scepter of Azj'Aqir, from Archaeology, can be used anywhere, while  Blue Qiraji Resonating Crystal,  Green Qiraji Resonating Crystal,  Red Qiraji Resonating Crystal, and  Yellow Qiraji Resonating Crystal can only be used inside Temple of Ahn'Qiraj.
