title:  "Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian"

The legendary staff wielded by each Guardian of Tirisfal, Atiesh was the first caster legendary, having slightly different itemization for Mages, Warlocks, Priests, and Druids. (Each version of the staff also has a different colored ribbon, to note class differences.) 

It also notably buffed party members--for example,  Power of the Guardian. As for vanity effects, it summons a flock of ravens around the caster's head and can be used to open a portal to Karazhan. While the weapon is no longer obtainable, owners receive  Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian--and it's a fun quest series to highlight.

Players first retrieved 40  Splinter of Atiesh from bosses in original Naxxramas. These were turned into  Frame of Atiesh.
In  Frame of Atiesh, players must speak to Anachronos in Tanaris to learn more, who gives players  Atiesh, the Befouled Greatstaff.

 Atiesh, the Befouled Greatstaff requires players to loot  Staff Head of Atiesh (100% droprate from Kel'Thuzad with the quest) and  Base of Atiesh (100% droprate from C'Thun with the quest).
The final part of the quest chain required players to summon Atiesh, a demon in Stratholme, and to defeat him. Atiesh wields  Andonisus, Reaper of Souls, dropping it in the course of the fight. The player can then use this weapon against the demon. Defeating the demon completes  Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian, allowing the caster to obtain the legendary.
