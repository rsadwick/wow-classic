Shaman are the spiritual leaders of their tribes and clans. They are masters of the elements, using spells and totems that heal or enhance their allies in battle while unleashing the fury of the elements upon their foes. Shaman can wear medium armor, and even wield massive two-handed weapons in combat. 

They are a versatile class that can wade into battle, restoring their allies while hurling elemental bolts of lightning at their enemies.
